# Seinfeld-Doorbell
This is a continuing project for fun. This system plays a Seinfeld bass rift when someone walks through a door. 
This was originally coded by Carmine Freda. 

This code uses a temperature sensor to activate one of 20 different Seinfeld bass rift effects. They are stored in an SD card attached with an Arduino shield

The code was farther modified to add a doorbell functionality. knock.wav can be replaced with any file to have a doorbell.
